# OOPS_CPP
OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. An object is an instance of a class, and a class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects. OOPS is widely used in many programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and more.
1. Class and Object
Class: A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and the methods (functions) common to all objects of a certain kind.
Object: An instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.
2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. This is achieved through access specifiers like private, protected, and public.
3. Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child/subclass) can inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass). It allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (subclass has a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass).
5. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This is done using abstract classes and interfaces in languages like Java.
